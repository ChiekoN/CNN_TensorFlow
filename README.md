# Convolution Neural Networks by TensorFlow

## Overview

 I built a CNN model that classifies MNIST handwritten digits using TensorFlow.

## Files

 - `Convolution_TensorFlow.ipynb` : Main file (requires **jupyter notebook**).
 - `Convolution_TensorFlow.html` : HTML version which is convenient to inspect the code and outputs in the file above without jupyter notebook.


## Takeaway

 - Understanding of TensorFlow graphs, sessions, variables, placeholders, functions for NN, etc.
 - Learning how to save and restore TensorFlow variables
 - Implementing CNNs with TensorFlow
 - How to rescale image data, and how to preprocess label data
 - How to create mini batches
